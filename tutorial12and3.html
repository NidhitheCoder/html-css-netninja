        HTML (HyperText Markup Language) is the most basic building block of the
        Web. It defines the meaning and structure of web content. Other
        technologies besides HTML are generally used to describe a web page's
        appearance/presentation (CSS) or functionality/behavior
        (JavaScript)."Hypertext" refers to links that connect web pages to one
        another, either within a single website or between websites. Links are a
        fundamental aspect of the Web. By uploading content to the Internet and
        linking it to pages created by other people, you become an active
        participant in the World Wide Web.HTML uses "markup" to annotate text,
        images, and other content for display in a Web browser.
