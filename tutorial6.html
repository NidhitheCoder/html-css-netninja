          Idukki is a district in the Indian state of Kerala. It was constituted
          on 26 January 1972, by splitting the district of Kottayam into two
          parts. Its division was earlier headquartered at Kottayam city, but
          moved to Painavu in June 1976. Idukki district lies amid the Western
          Ghats of Kerala. Though it is regarded as the second-largest district
          in the region, it has the lowest population density among the
          districts of Kerala, the urban population being higher than the rural.
          Idukki is rich in forests and also known as the "Spice Garden of
          Kerala"Munnar Tea plantations in Munnar Munnar was the summer resort
          of the British Government in the south. The town is situated at the
          convergence of three mountain streams, namely Muthirappuzha,
          Nallathanni, and Kundala. Munnar has some of the largest tea
          plantations in the world. This hill station, which is more than 5,000
          feet above sea level, is a tourist attraction noted for its scenic
          landscapes. Most of the native flora and fauna of Munnar have
          disappeared due to severe habitat fragmentation resultant from the
          creation of the plantations. However, some species continue to survive
          and thrive in several protected areas nearby, including the new
          Kurinjimala Sanctuary to the east, the Chinnar Wildlife Sanctuary,
          Manjampatti Valley, and the Amaravati reserve forest of Indira Gandhi
          Wildlife Sanctuary to the northeast, the Eravikulam National Park and
          Anamudi Shola National Park in the north, and the Pampadum Shola
          National Park to the south. The Palani Hills National Park is proposed
          to come up to the east of Idukki. These protected areas are especially
          known for several threatened and endemic species including the Nilgiri
          tahr, the grizzled giant squirrel, the Nilgiri wood-pigeon, the
          elephant, the gaur, the Nilgiri langur, the sambar, and the
          neelakurinji (that blossoms only once in twelve years). The former
          Kunda Valley Railway in Munnar was destroyed by a flood in 1924, but
          tourism officials are considering reconstructing the railway line to
          attract tourists
